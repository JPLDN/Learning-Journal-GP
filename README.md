Planning and Brainstorming Ideas for my tutorials:
- First Person movement and jumping in a 3d Environment.
- Taking damage i.e. from high ground, from objects like Spikes
- Meter bar for things like HP


- Started the First Person Movement, first starting with using a random game object (capsule) and tested its horizontal movement.
- Searched through tutorials and had a go at them. Bumped into many issues such as misunderstanding certain scripts and objects in Unity.
- The main reason for this was because the tutorial had skipped major parts i.e. didnt show the process of creating emptyobjects, cameras etc.
- It also referenced to other tutorials they had created, so it wasn't exactly successful when working on the movement. So instead, I looked for a new tutorial and that was successful.
- As I was planning, I realised that those should be done after I do other steps, i.e. taking damage means I'd have to make a health system. So I took a step back, and decided a HP system should be completed first.

- Continued with First Person POV movement, searched for other tutorials.
- Decided to work on First Person POV first and was successful, little to no issues/errors.
- Began working on movement
- First started with the Camera, created a script solely for the Camera, the camera being in first person POV and it is controlled simply by moving the mouse.
- I attached the main camera, that is created from simply creating a Unity project, to my Player and the first person POV was successful, as well as the camera movement.
- Went back to work on player movement, and it was somewhat confusing and bumped into a lot of issues since I wasn't able to understand what was going on, so I restarted and searched for a different tutorial.
- The main reason for it, was because the tutorial I was looking at, had skipped a few major steps, like creating the empty objects and making more than 1 camera, so I was unsure of what to do, and couldn't figure it out.
- I looked for a different tutorial, and this tutorial was a lot better at explaining, and included the major parts when explaining how things works and what to add.
- Movement became a lot more successful, with little to no issues. It contains simple movement with jumping, and has a lookXLimit so it doesnt look further than say 90 degrees.

- Finalised the player Movement, and began to work on the Health System.
- I found a tutorial on a health system that functions like Dark Souls, and used the tutorial to help on the health system.
- I bumped into a small issue where, one of the HP bars, which functions as the main HP, to not actually appear in the scene.
- What I did was, rearrange some of th objects and emptyobjects in the inspector, connecting so that it becomes a parent/child.
- I had had to re-shape the hp bar since I found out that, duplicating an object, doesn't fully copy everything and that was what went wrong, so once I fixed the shape of the main HP Bar, it displayed in the scene and works
how it should do.

- Last week I finished the health system, and now this week, it's about my player taking damage.
- I'll be experimenting i.e. taking damage from other objects (these objects will be playing as enemies/environmental objects i.e. spikes) and fall damage.
- I began searching for a tutorial online.
