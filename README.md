Planning and Brainstorming Ideas for my tutorials:
- First Person movement and jumping in a 3d Environment.
- Taking damage i.e. from high ground, from objects like Spikes
- Meter bar for things like HP


- Started the First Person Movement, first starting with using a random game object (cube) and tested its horizontal movement.
- Searched through tutorials and had a go at them. Bumped into many issues such as misunderstanding certain scripts and objects in Unity.

- Continued with First Person POV movement, searched for other tutorials.
- Decided to work on First Person POV first and was successful, little to no issues/errors.
- Began working on movement
