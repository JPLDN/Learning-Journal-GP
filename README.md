Planning and Brainstorming Ideas for my tutorials:
- First Person movement and jumping in a 3d Environment.
- Taking damage i.e. from high ground, from objects like Spikes
- Meter bar for things like HP


- Started the First Person Movement, first starting with using a random game object (capsule) and tested its horizontal movement.
- Searched through tutorials and had a go at them. Bumped into many issues such as misunderstanding certain scripts and objects in Unity.
- As I was planning, I realised that those should be done after I do other steps, i.e. taking damage means I'd have to make a health system. So I took a step back, and decided a HP system should be completed first.

- Continued with First Person POV movement, searched for other tutorials.
- Decided to work on First Person POV first and was successful, little to no issues/errors.
- Began working on movement
- First started with the Camera, created a script solely for the Camera, the camera being in first person POV and it is controlled simply by moving the mouse.
- I attached the main camera, that is created from simply creating a Unity project, to my Player and the first person POV was successful, as well as the camera movement.
- Went back to work on player movement, and it was somewhat confusing and bumped into a lot of issues since I wasn't able to understand what was going on, so I restarted and searched for a different tutorial.
- The main reason for it, was because the tutorial I was looking at, had skipped a few major steps, like creating the empty objects and making more than 1 camera, so I was unsure of what to do, and couldn't figure it out.
- I looked for a different tutorial, and this tu
- Movement became a lot more successful, with little to no issues. It contains simple movement with jumping, and has a lookXLimit so it doesnt look further than say 90 degrees.

- Finalised the player Movement, and began to work on the Health System.
- I found a tutorial on a health system that functions like Dark Souls, and used the tutorial to help on the health system.
